Rating system needs to include DNA stats

Contracts/applications will include:
 - Our basic terms (it's not our fault)
 - Customisable terms (fee, % payment on cancellation, etc)
 - Custom terms (terms that contradict basic/customisable terms deemed invalid)

Separate users (or not!) and roles/permissions for employers (i.e. bill payers) and sites (i.e. pharmacy managers posting jobs).
